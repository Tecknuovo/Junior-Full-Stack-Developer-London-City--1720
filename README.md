# Junior-Full-Stack-Developer-InsureTech-London-City-1720
# Junior Full Stack .Net Developer – London (City) – £60,000 to £75,000 

# Stack: 
C#, .Net, JavaScript, React, SaaS 

# The company: 
Small but well established Insuretech business offering SaaS and Cloud based solutions to a range of specialist insurance businesses. Through a set of unique applications, they help traditional insurance firms offer digital solutions to their customers and enable them to gain a competitive advantage through the utilisation of the latest advances in computing. 

# The environment/Culture: 
A small team in a friendly office who work in a collaborative manner within an incredibly flat structure. People are expected to take responsibility for all aspects of their role. There is the opportunity to learn from experienced developers in the team, but self-learning is strongly encouraged and if you are a developer who like to wear more than one hat then you will thrive here. 

# The role: 
Initially you will be working on an existing suite of applications that require a UI overhaul (currently Angular 1). You will take on most of the rewrite and this work will be JavaScript with React. You will probably be the kind of developer who cares about “look and feel” and will enjoy delivering slick looking UI’s. That said you will not be the kind of person whose interest begins and ends with front end but will likely be someone who likes diving into the full stack as well. 

# What experience is required?

-	Some commercial development experience in both JavaScript and C#  the team would ideally like someone who has worked for a software company and have delivered end to end projects for customers. That said if you have had a year in industry whilst studying that might cut it. 
-	The ability to work autonomously. 
-	An interest in understanding the business domain with a view to basing technical decisions on improving the experience of the customer.
